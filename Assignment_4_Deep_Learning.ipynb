        "In this tutorial, we'll build a deep learning model to decode stimulus information from the responses of sensory neurons. Specifically, we'll look at the activity of ~20,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex responding to oriented gratings recorded in [this study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679324v2.abstract). Our task is to decode the orientation of the presented stimulus from the responses of the whole population of neurons.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will start by learning how to build a deep feed-forward network using PyTorch. We will then evaluate the network's outputs using PyTorch's built-in loss functions. After that we will see how gradients of the loss function are related to each parameter of the network and compute them using automatic differentiation\n",

        "Finally we will implement gradient descent to optimize our network's parameters.Let's begin then."
